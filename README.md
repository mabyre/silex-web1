## Why Silex has no future

Just because it's takes Html has shit !

So tupid to create a html generator that make htmi unreadable !

Look at commit 

https://github.com/mabyre/silex-web1/commit/9bafca96777f8935cfc842efba92955ad2c950f4

Each time I add an element a section or a button html became unreadable WHY !!!!?

Is it redhibitory ... 

May be not, because Silex does not refactor all code, thanks to god !

But I was very scared.

That's All Folks
